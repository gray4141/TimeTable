# TimeTable
A time clock program for small businesses
Python/SQLite

This program allows users to sign in securely, clock-in/clock-out and access their activity and total hours for any date range.  
The user can clock out/in for break times which are not counted in total hours to be paid. 
Total hours are broken down into regular hours, overtime hours, and double overtime hours (where any hours over 12 in one day are considered double overtime)
User passwords are stored hashed/salted in the database.

This is a rough work in progress and any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
